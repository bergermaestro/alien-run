# Alien-Run

Alien Run is an 'infinite-runner' game modelled after the Google Chrome dinosaur game, where an alien is running through a forest trying to make its way back to their ship.
The game is coded in Java Swing, which was certainly an interesting expereince in terms of using a package that is not relatively uncommon for creating such graphics.

The game includes a scoreboard, as well as theme music and sound effects.
